# My-Shell
I have written my own shell in C

Steps for execution:

    1. Download all the files
    2. run the .sh file


The shell can run the following commands:

     1. help(displays the built in commands)
     2. history (to display all the previous commands)
     3. history n (for displaying last 'n' commands ) 
     4. cd (for changing directory)  
     5. exit(to exit out of the terminal)
     6. piping 
     7. redirection
     8. ctrl + c 

For any running any command, three steps are involved:

     1. Read the command from standard input.
     2. Parse the command.
     3. Execute the parsed command.
